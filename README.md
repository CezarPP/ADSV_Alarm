# Adservio Message Alarm

Simple program made for all my friends who had to refresh the page constantly to see when the teacher sent them their Zoom link.

It logs onto the site with their username and password and refreshes the page every few seconds to see if it has changed.

I have little experince in python, this is just my intuition of how this task might be accomplished, I'm sure there are other easier ways.
